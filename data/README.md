This directory houses transcriptome data for each coral species analyzed. **The jupyter (IPython) notebook workflows direct downloads of the publicly available datasets to this directory.** Coral species subdirectories include:

  `Ahya` - *Acropora hyacinthus* 
  
  `Amil` - *Acropora millepora* 
  
  `Apalm` - *Acropora palmata* 
  
  `Past` - *Porites astreoides* 
  
  `Pdam` - *Pocillopora damicornis* 
  
  `Spist` - *Stylophora pistillata*
