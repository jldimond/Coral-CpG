The file blast2go_fasta_Pdamv2.fasta is a *Pocillopora damicornis* transcriptome assembly downloaded from http://2ei.univ-perp.fr/telechargement/transcriptomes/blast2go_fasta_Pdamv2.zip on 2/19/2015. It was originally featured in an article by [Vidal-Dupiol et al. (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058652). The transcriptome was developed from adult *P. damicornis* and consists of 72,890 contigs. According to the authors, "...27.7% and 69.8% of the contigs were predicted to belong to the symbiont and the host transcriptome, respectively. The remaining contigs could not be taxonomically attributed."
