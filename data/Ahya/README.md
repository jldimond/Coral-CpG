This read me file describes the FASTA file named "33496_Ahyacinthus_CoralContigs.fasta". It was dowloaded from http://palumbi.stanford.edu/data/33496_Ahyacinthus_CoralContigs.fasta.zip on 1/15/2015. This is a transcriptome of the coral *Acropora hyacinthus*. It was featured in Barshis et al. (2013). The supporting information file contains detailed information on the methods used to create the transcriptome. Briefly, the transcriptome contains 33,496 contigs with high similarity to other cnidarian sequences. The authors used coral and dinoflagellate sequences to filter out dinoflagellate sequences, so the transcriptome contains mostly coral transcripts.

The file "Ahya_diff_contigs" is a text file that lists the 484 contigs that were differentially expressed between control and heated corals, regardless of source population. The contig IDs are the same as those in the transcriptome above. The file was obtained from an [Excel file]((http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2013/01/02/1210224110.DCSupplemental/sd01.xlsx) that was downloaded from the supplementary info page at http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1387.abstract.

The file Barshis_etal_33496contigs_deduped_all_scaledounts_Nov2012.txt is a text file with gene expression counts for *A. hyacinthis* across all treatments. It was downloaded from http://palumbi.stanford.edu/data/Barshis_etal_33496contigs_deduped_all_scaledounts_Nov2012.txt on 9/7/2015.
