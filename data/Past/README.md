The transcriptome data for *Porites astreoides* were originally generated by [Kenkel et al. (2013)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.12390/full). The data were obtained from the [Matz Lab website](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37523721/pastreoides_transcriptome_july2014.zip). The transcriptome was developed from adult tissue, with transcripts showing high similarity to those in a *Symbiodinium* transcriptome filtered out.
